## About

This is my Web Development Portfolio in here I showcase the skills and projects I've learned in this past two semester and in my own free time as well.

## Process

1. **Design**: I started by outlining the structure and design of the portfolio, I named each section that i was planning to work on and focused on one section at a time, that why I'm able to concentrate fully in each section

2. **Development**: I used HTML, Bootstrap and some CSS mostly for colors and animations for the layout and responsiveness of the website. Each project I have on my portfolio comes from assignments I had to do on my first two semesters with the exception of the background color generator, because that one includes some javascript that I learned on my own.

3. **Responsive Images**: I used the `<picture>` element to create appropriate image sizes based on  three different popular screen sizes. 

4. **Animations**: To enhance the user experience based on my original design from my Ux design class, I added more animations using CSS transitions and hover effects for buttons and images.

5. **Accessibility**: I ensured that the website is accessible by using semantic HTML elements, providing alt text for images, and maintaining good color contrast and by validating and testing how accesible my website with the help of some online validators such as:https://accessibe.com/

## Challenges

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looks and functions well on various screen sizes was a challenge, specially when it came to the images thanks to the fact that I struggled in keeping them centered in the mobile screen size, optimizing images for different screen sizes without compromising quality was challenging so i decided to use  responsive images and SVGs instead of png's for most of the siteand it helped me fix this issue.

- **CSS Animations**: Animations where the easiest part of this project, I decided to use very simple animations that look good and make the Ux on my portfolio a lot better and be more responsive without going to far in how extreme the animations could be.

## Learned from this project

- **Design and Development Balance**: I learned that finding a good balance when it comes to design and development is very important, I noticed that while I was developing this site there where some design choices I made that wouldn't be ideal for me when developing a website and it made me realize how important it is that in the very beginning of the process while I'm designing and creating wireframes, to think about how the website is going to be developed.

- **Bootstap**: I learned a lot more about how to use everything that bootsrap has to offer. In the beginning of the project I struggled a lot when it came to understanding how the bootstrap classes were supposed to be used and it made me be stuck on things that I could have developed by coding it myself such as the nav bar, but after I continued using it to create everything on my page I noticed how easy it is once you understand it and how fast it let's you build websites.
