## About

This is my Web Development Portfolio in here I showcase the skills and projects I've learned in this past two semester and in my own free time as well.

## Process

1. **Design**: I started by outlining the structure and design of the portfolio, I named each section that i was planning to work on and focused on one section at a time, that why I'm able to concentrate fully in each section

2. **Development**: I used HTML, Bootstrap and some CSS mostly for colors and animations for the layout and responsiveness of the website. Each project I have on my portfolio comes from assignments I had to do on my first two semesters with the exception of the background color generator, because that one includes some javascript that I learned on my own.

3. **Responsive Images**: I used the `<picture>` element to create appropriate image sizes based on  three different popular screen sizes. 

4. **Animations**: To enhance the user experience based on my original design from my Ux design class, I added more animations using CSS transitions and hover effects for buttons and images.

5. **Accessibility**: I ensured that the website is accessible by using semantic HTML elements, providing alt text for images, and maintaining good color contrast and by validating and testing how accesible my website with the help of some online validators such as:https://accessibe.com/
